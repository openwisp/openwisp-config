Quick Start Guide
=================

To install the Config Agent on your OpenWrt system, follow these steps:

Download and install the latest build from `downloads.openwisp.io
<http://downloads.openwisp.io/?prefix=openwisp-config/>`_. Copy the URL of
the IPK file you want to download, then run the following commands on your
OpenWrt device:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /tmp  # /tmp runs in memory
    wget <URL-just-copied>
    opkg update
    opkg install ./<file-just-downloaded>

Replace ``<URL-just-copied>`` with the URL of the package from
`downloads.openwisp.io
<http://downloads.openwisp.io/?prefix=openwisp-config/>`_.

You can also install from the official OpenWrt packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    opkg update
    opkg install openwisp-config

.. important::

    **We recommend installing from our latest builds** because the OpenWrt
    packages are not always up to date.

Once the config agent is installed, you need to configure it. Edit the
config file located at ``/etc/config/openwisp``.

You will see the default config file, as shown below.

.. code-block:: text

    # For more information about the config options please see the README
    # or https://openwisp.io/docs/dev/openwrt-config-agent/user/settings.html

    config controller 'http'
        #option url 'https://openwisp2.mynetwork.com'
        #option interval '120'
        #option verify_ssl '1'
        #option shared_secret ''
        #option consistent_key '1'
        #option mac_interface 'eth0'
        #option management_interface 'tun0'
        #option merge_config '1'
        #option test_config '1'
        #option test_script '/usr/sbin/mytest'
        #option hardware_id_script '/usr/sbin/read_hw_id'
        #option hardware_id_key '1'
        option uuid ''
        option key ''
        # curl options
        #option connect_timeout '15'
        #option max_time '30'
        #option capath '/etc/ssl/certs'
        #option cacert '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
        # hooks
        #option pre_reload_hook '/usr/sbin/my_pre_reload_hook'
        #option post_reload_hook '/usr/sbin/my_post_reload_hook'

Uncomment and change the following fields:

- ``url``: the hostname of your OpenWISP controller. For example, if you
  are hosting your OpenWISP server locally and set the IP Address to
  "192.168.56.2", the url would be ``https://192.168.56.2``.
- ``verify_ssl``: set to ``'0'`` if your controller's SSL certificate is
  self-signed; in production, you need a valid SSL certificate to keep
  your instance secure.
- ``shared_secret``: you can retrieve this from the OpenWISP admin panel,
  in the Organization settings. The list of organizations is available at
  ``/admin/openwisp_users/organization/``.
- ``management_interface``: this is the interface which OpenWISP uses to
  reach the device. Please refer to :doc:`/user/vpn` for more information.

.. note::

    When testing or developing using the Django development server
    directly from your computer, make sure the server listens on all
    interfaces (``./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000``) and then just
    point OpenWISP Config to use your local IP address (e.g.,
    ``http://192.168.1.34:8000``).

Save the file and start openwisp-config:

.. code-block:: bash

    /etc/init.d/openwisp-config restart

Your OpenWrt device should register itself to your OpenWISP controller.
Check the devices page in the OpenWISP admin dashboard to make sure your
device has registered successfully.
